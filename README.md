"For the practical aspect of setting them up/plugging them in:
The seaphets are on internal batteries and these should have a lot of power left so they shouldn't need to be powered up by something else.
One of the prooceanus sensors has an internal battery pack and the little one does not. For ease of use today i'd take the approach of powering both the same way assuming there is no internavl power pack. 
To do this in the lab you will need to find the car battery charger and charge up the large 12v batteries (these may be dead so i'd do this first thing). 

The cables were in a muddle when i got them back from Shawn but the correct ones for each sensor should be in the respective boxes.  You can ignore the 5m extensions as you won't need them.

For the seaphets you should only need to connect the comms cable into the cable to DS9 then a DS9 to usb. If i remember the one you want is hanging on the side, not one of the ones on the top.  

For the pro oceanus, there is a power/comms port, this is the only one you should need to use if i remember. We got them to build an adapter for us, so there should be a cable that splits to power red/black cables with loops, then on the other end of the cable is the comms which similarly is DB9 and goes to USB.

A word of warning that some of the USB converters are a pain and they are not all compatible with the instruments and with laptops, this could be something that stops you connecting."
